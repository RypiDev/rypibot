## Ways to contribute

### Contributing code

Code-level contributions in this project come in the form of [pull requests](https://github.com/RypiDev/rypibot/pulls). These are done by forking the repo and making changes locally.

The process of proposing a change to this project can be summarized as follows:

1. Clone the repository and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Make the desired changes or features you would like to implement.
3. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally. (or on CI once you have opened a PR)
4. Push all of your changes. (We are using conventional commits for keeping a clean repo.)
5. Create a pull request to the repository.
6. Review if needed and address comments on your pull request.
7. If changes are requested and addressed, please request review to notify reviewers to take another look.
8. If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.

### GitHub Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs exclusively.
